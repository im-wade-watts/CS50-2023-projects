Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: Simulations with N equal to 100000 and 1000000, as they have values of countries with a 0% chance of winning the world cup.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Depois de 1000 simulações.
